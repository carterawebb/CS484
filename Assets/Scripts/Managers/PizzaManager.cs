    /// This script manages the pizza making process.

    /// It should:
    /// - Keep track of the current pizza being made (in a list?)
    /// - Check (when done) if the pizza is correct
    /// - Keep track of the score
    /// - Subtract points for mistakes (extra toppings, wrong toppings, etc.)
    /// - Subtract points for taking too long
    /// 
    /// The user should be able to drag and drop toppings onto the pizza which
    /// will be placed on top of the last thing they dropped it on. The topping models
    /// will be associated with a simplified game object that will be placed on the pizza.
